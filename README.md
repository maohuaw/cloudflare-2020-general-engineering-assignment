# General Assignment

My deployed site link is in URL.txt. I finished all extra credits. Here is [my finished system assignment](https://github.com/maohuaw/WebProfileTool).

### Extra Credit
1. (finished) Provide social links

Remove the `display: none` style from `div#social`, and add any number of social links as children to the container. The children of this container should be `a` links, with `svg` icons as the children of those links. For example SVGs, use https://simpleicons.org.

```js
<div id="links">
  <a href="someurl.com">
    <svg></svg>
  </a>
</div>
```

2. (finished) Update the title field

Using the HTMLRewriter, target the `title` tag and update the text inside to your name.

3. (finished) Change the background color

Using HTMLRewriter, target the `body` element and change the background color. You can simply swap out the `bg-gray-900` class with another class from [Tailwind CSS's color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), or set a `background-color` style to a color, gradient, or image of your choice.

4. (finished) Do the [Systems Assignment](https://github.com/cloudflare-hiring/cloudflare-2020-systems-engineering-assignment) that depends on the work you've done here.
